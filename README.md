5. The KEYOES BadUSB Controller interface should load, featuring a sleek Kali Linux-inspired terminal design

## üíª Using the Controller

### Web Interface

The web interface provides a sophisticated terminal-like experience with the following features:

- **Script Editor**: A central textarea for writing or pasting your BadUSB scripts
- **Upload Button**: Saves the script to the device without executing it
- **Execute Button**: Runs the saved script through the connected USB interface
- **Clear Button**: Erases the script editor content
- **Command History**: Shows previously executed commands and their status
- **Payloads Log**: Records executed payloads with timestamps (accessed via the "Payloads Log" tab)

### Script Syntax

The BadUSB controller supports an extended version of the Ducky Script language:

```
STRING <text>           # Types the specified text
DELAY <milliseconds>    # Waits for the specified time in milliseconds
CHAR_DELAY <ms>         # Sets the delay between keystrokes (default: 10ms)
REM <comment>           # Comment (not executed)
// <comment>            # Alternative comment syntax

# Key commands
<key>                   # Presses a single key (e.g., ENTER, SPACE, TAB)
<key1>+<key2>+<key3>    # Presses a key combination (e.g., CTRL+ALT+T)
```

#### Supported Special Keys

The controller supports a comprehensive range of keys including:

- Modifiers: `CTRL`, `SHIFT`, `ALT`, `GUI` (Windows/Command key)
- Function keys: `F1` through `F12`
- Navigation: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `HOME`, `END`, `PAGEUP`, `PAGEDOWN`
- System keys: `ESC`, `TAB`, `CAPSLOCK`, `PRINTSCREEN`, `DELETE`, etc.

### Example Script

```
REM Open command prompt in Windows
GUI+r
DELAY 500
STRING cmd
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING echo Hello, this is a BadUSB example!
ENTER
```

### API Access

For programmatic control, you can use the RESTful API endpoint:

```
POST http://<pico-ip>/api/badusb
```

With JSON payload for uploading a script:
```json
{
  "action": "upload",
  "script": "STRING Hello World\nDELAY 500\nENTER"
}
```

For executing a previously uploaded script:
```json
{
  "action": "execute"
}
```

You can also send a raw script as the request body to upload and immediately execute it:
```
POST http://<pico-ip>/api/badusb
Content-Type: text/plain

STRING Hello World
DELAY 500
ENTER
```

### WiFi Status Monitoring

The web interface includes a real-time WiFi status indicator that shows:
- Connection status (connected/disconnected)
- Current IP address
- Connection losses or timeout issues

You can also query the WiFi status programmatically:
```
GET http://<pico-ip>/wifi-status
```

## Payload Development Best Practices

### Timing Optimization

Fine-tune your attack payloads with strategic timing for maximum reliability:

```
CHAR_DELAY 30    # IMPORTANT: Minimum recommended delay for reliable keystroke registration
STRING cd /tmp && mkdir test
ENTER
DELAY 500        # Allow system time to process command before continuing
```

### Target-Specific Adaptations

Adjust your payloads based on the target operating system:

- **Windows**: Use `GUI+r` to open Run dialog, then execute commands
- **macOS**: Use `GUI+SPACE` to open Spotlight, then launch applications
- **Linux**: Use `CTRL+ALT+T` to open terminal on many distributions

### Multi-phase Payloads

For complex attacks, structure your payloads into logical phases:

```
REM Phase 1: Establish access
GUI+r
DELAY 200
STRING cmd.exe
ENTER
DELAY 500

REM Phase 2: Execute primary payload
STRING echo Executing primary payload...
ENTER
```

## Known Issues

### Bug: CHAR_DELAY should have a minimum of 30ms to prevent data loss

#### Description
When executing BadUSB payloads through the KEYOES controller, the current default character delay of 10ms (`char_delay = 0.01` in the code) causes reliability issues. Characters are frequently dropped or misinterpreted during payload execution, especially with longer commands or when targeting systems under load.

#### Current Implementation
In the current code (`execute_script()` function), the default setting is:
```python
char_delay = 0.01  # 10ms between characters
```

The `CHAR_DELAY` command exists but has no minimum value enforcement.

#### Recommended Fix
Always use `CHAR_DELAY 30` (or higher) at the beginning of your scripts to ensure reliable execution. For example:

```
REM Set a safer character delay first
CHAR_DELAY 30
STRING echo This script will execute reliably
ENTER
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The web interface supports several keyboard shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+T`: Switch to Terminal tab
- `Ctrl+P`: Switch to Payloads Log tab
- `Ctrl+Enter`: Execute current script
- `Ctrl+S`: Upload current script

## Safely Editing the Python Code

To edit the `code.py` file without risking automatic execution:

1. Enter BOOTSEL mode (hold the BOOTSEL button when connecting the device)
2. Temporarily modify the `boot.py` file to prevent automatic execution:
   ```python
   # Comment out these lines to disable keyboard simulation
   # usb_cdc.disable()
   # storage.disable_usb_drive()
   
   # Add this line to enable USB drive mode
   storage.enable_usb_drive()
   ```
3. Save the changes and safely eject
4. Now when you connect the Pico normally, it will mount as a storage device
5. Edit `code.py` as needed
6. Remember to revert the `boot.py` changes when finished

## Technical Details

### Key Mapping System
The device uses a comprehensive key mapping system that translates string commands to USB HID keycodes:

```python
KEY_MAPPING = {
    "CTRL": Keycode.CONTROL, "SHIFT": Keycode.SHIFT, "ALT": Keycode.ALT,
    "GUI": Keycode.GUI, "WINDOWS": Keycode.GUI, "WIN": Keycode.GUI,
    # ... additional mappings for all supported keys
}
```

### WiFi Reconnection Logic
The device implements a robust WiFi connection system with automatic retries:

```python
def connect_to_wifi():
    max_attempts, retry_delay, attempt = 10, 5, 0
    
    while True:
        attempt += 1
        # ... connection logic
        
        if attempt % max_attempts == 0:
            # Reset the device after multiple failed attempts
            try:
                microcontroller.reset()
            except:
                pass
```

### Script Storage
Scripts can be stored either in the device's filesystem or in memory if file operations fail:

```python
def save_script(script_content):
    try:
        # ... file operations
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error saving script: {e}")
        global script_in_memory
        script_in_memory = script_content
        return True
```
